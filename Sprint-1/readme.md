# ðŸ§­ Guide to Sprint 1 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this week.

## Setup

Make sure your terminal is in the `Sprint-1` directory of this repository.

Run the command `npm install` to install any dependencies you need.
`npm init -y`  for the package.json
`npm --save-dev jest`  for the jest # dependancies

## Note about separate files

This may be the first time you've seen the functions being defined in one file, and the tests in another.

This is common when writing JavaScript. You'll learn more about `exports` and `require` later in the course. For now, things have been set up to work - you shouldn't need to worry about how.

## Fix

In this section, you'll have a function and some tests. The function isn't working for all the tests - you'll need to:

- Run the tests - to run the tests for the `fix` directory you can `cd` into `Sprint-1` and run `npm test -- fix`.
- Interpret the test feedback
- Fix the tests

## ðŸ”¨ Implement

In this section, you will have a short set of requirements about a function. You will need to implement a function based off this set of requirements. Make sure you check your function works for a number of different inputs.

Here is a recommended order:

1. `max.test.js`
2. `sum.test.js`
3. `dedupe.test.js`

Again, you can run just the test for the `implement` directory if you're in the `Sprint-1` directory by running `npm test -- implement`.

## ðŸ§¹ Refactor

In these problems, you'll be given an implementation and then asked to change it. Once you've updated the implementations you'll need to double check that they are still working!

Once you've completed all these tasks, raise a PR with your work so far. Don't wait to complete your coursework before completing the PR.

## Stretch ðŸ’ª

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual challenge of interesting exercises to try. Lots of programmers do these every year for fun.

We've included an exercise in the stretch directory - give it a go!
